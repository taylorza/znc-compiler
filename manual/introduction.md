# Introduction

ZNC is a small C-like language for the ZX Spectrum Next. It is intended for writing compact native code and inline Z80N assembly that can be produced as DOT commands, NEX binaries, or raw binaries.

This manual documents the language features that the compiler implements (no hypothetical features). The content corresponds to the compiler code in this repository and its RTL/library support.
